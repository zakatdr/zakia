In a world where vulnerable children are struggling to access quality education and basic needs, one non-profit organization is making a difference. 

 Ryvanz-Mia Charity is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization dedicated to improving the lives of vulnerable children and women in Ghana and other partner countries in Africa. We started as an orphanage and childcare center in 2006, with a mission to provide for vulnerable children and create an environment in which they can reach their full potential. Today, it has grown into a successful non-profit organization that supports underprivileged communities through multiple programs and initiatives.
